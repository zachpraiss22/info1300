        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>Hailing from nearly every state in the United States and from numerous countries across the world, the Class of 2016 was the most diverse in the history of Cornell when we started off as little freshmen.  Since then, we have also proven to be on the most hard working and talented classes in the history of the university.
        <br/><br/>

        The Senior Class Campaign recognizes that we only got this far thanks to the amazing facilities, resources, and people that make Cornell what it is.  As such, it is our duty to give back to the very institution that shaped who we are today.  Even if it is just a couple dollars, it will make a difference in not only funding the normal operations of the university, but also demonstrating our loyalty and appreciation for Cornell.

          Why should I give back to Cornell in the Senior Class Campaign?
          Why does the university need any more of my money?
          Where is it going to go?
          <br/><br/>

          These are all important questions that we want to make sure you have the
          right answer to!  One should give back to the Senior Class Campaign
          because it is a demonstration of the appreciation we have as seniors
          for our time at Cornell.  All donations go to the Cornell Annual Fund,
          which helps fund the normal operations of the university and provide
          the money various programs and faculty on campus need to reach higher
          and go beyond in what they do.  By donating to the Senior Class Campaign,
          you also have the option to donate to a specific program within the university.
